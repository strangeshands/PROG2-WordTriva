### Mechanics of The Game 
**As a player**
  1. Set board size.
  2. Provide the word list. Type in any of the *.txt* files provided. Ensure the number of words is sufficient for the board size set, at least 10 more words.
      - Some of the .txt files were modified. File names can be misleading when it comes to number of words.
  3. For every row, you can choose any letter and guess the word with the help of the clues provided. The game ends when no word is correctly guessed on the current row.
  4. You can also select categories depending on your interests. All words that will be generated will be under that category.

**As a game master**
